# Stroke-Prediction-with-SAS
This project aims to try out some basic strategies for the prediction of rare events. The dataset used for this exploration comes from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset. \
The classification algorithms used were logistic regression, decision trees and random forests. They perform quite poorly on the dataset since their prediction classifies everything into the majority class. \
The strategies used to overcome this hurdle are undersampling and oversampling, which we compare.
